## Musrch

Musrch is an app that brings together band/artist information in one click of a button. Imagine you're out at a concert and the opening band is somebody you've never heard of, you immediatly want to know tour dates, band info, and music videos of their top listened to tracks. Usually you would have multiple tabs open to get all of this information. With Musrch, all the info you want is on one page. We wanted to make it easy for all information you want as a music consumer is available.

# Problems
Not being able to use node to assist with APIs and SASS. Delegation of work seemed to be an issue. All our API calls have a quota in terms of how many times you call the API and retrieve information. Many issues arose with proper URL syntax, isolating the information from the APIs, and figuring out the logic to append the information to the hTML


# Plans for future updates
* Use the Spotify api instead of YouTube API because it provides more specificity.
* Use the Eventful API instead of Songkick due to better information.
* Pull band info/songs from a variety of sources to allowe
* User can save searches to refer to later


# Technology Used
