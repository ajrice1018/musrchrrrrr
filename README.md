## Musrch

Musrch is an app that brings together band/artist information in one click of a button. Imagine you're out at a concert and the opening band is somebody you've never heard of, you immediatly want to know tour dates, band info, and music videos of their top listened to tracks. Usually you would have multiple tabs open to get all of this information. With Musrch, all the info you want is on one page!
